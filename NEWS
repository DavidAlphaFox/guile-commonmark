This release update

** CommonMark changes

The changes make this implemenation now follows version 0.28 of the
CommonMark spec.

*** Tabs

Tabs are no longer expanded to spaces, however when parsing blocks
they behave like spaces with a tab stop of 4 characters.

*** Paragraphs

Spaces are now stripped from the end of paragraphs so that two or more
spaces will not become a hard line break.

*** Fenced code

Closing fences of fenced code blocks can now be longer than the
opening fence.

*** Link reference definitions

Link destinations can be enclosed in an opening < and > 

** Bug fixes

*** Fix nonportable range expression for control characters

glibc 2.28 made some changes to the collation of Unicode characters
which affect regular expression ranges. This caused the regular
expression range for control characters to match charaacters it
shouldn't.
